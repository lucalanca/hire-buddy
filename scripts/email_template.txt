Hello %{Company},
I saw your %{Position} position on %{Source} recently.

I’m building a product that will help companies hire the best people, and I hope
you might be open in sharing some insights about your process for evaluating
candidates’ skills. I see this as a problem given that you often don’t have
in-house resources to ask the right questions or grade them in an inpartial
manner.

I also would love to learn how hard is for you to establishing company-wide
standards for open positions or even the career ladder. 

I’m not trying to sell anything – just looking to learn about your business’s
problems so I can build something that helps you grow your business.

Cheers,
João
