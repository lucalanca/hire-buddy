<p>Hello %{Company},</p>

<p>I saw your %{Position} position on %{Source} recently.</p>

<p>I'm building a product that aims to help companies hire the best people, and I hope you might be open to share some insights about your process for <strong>evaluating candidates' skills</strong>. The issue I'm trying to address is that companies often don't have in-house resources to ask the right questions or even grade them in an impartial and informed manner.</p>

<p>I also would love to learn how hard it is for you to <strong>establish company-wide standards</strong> for open positions or even the career ladder.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to sell anything – just looking to learn about your business's problems so I can build something that helps you grow your business. </p>

Cheers from Portugal,<br>
João
